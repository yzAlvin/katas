# Blackjack Kata

* Console Based
* Only one player and dealer
* No gambling system

## Goals during this Kata:
* Test Driven Development
* Four Rules of Simple Design
* YAGNI

## Feedback to consider
* Group tests separately
* Descriptive test names
* Tests should 'tell a story'
* Test until you are sure the method does what it says it does
* Better to over-test than under-test
